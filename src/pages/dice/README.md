## Introduction

This is a Dapp demo that guesses the number. After the bet, select a number in 1-10 and the lottery number is generated 'randomly'. If the selected number is the same as the lottery number, you will receive a bonus.

Because MetaMask is used for transaction signing, please install MetaMask before using it. The demo is only deployed on the Ropsten test network. Please confirm that the current network of MetaMask is Ropsten before use.
